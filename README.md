# Project Title

Template to have an up and running project using HTML5 CSS3 JavaScript and SASS

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the template.

Remember to delete the existing README.md file and rename and update the README-template.md file.

You need to have installed SASS in your local machine to be able to compile the scss file in css.

If you don't need to use SASS, delete the 'scss' folder and edit the 'style.css' file directly.

### Prerequisites

To install SASS, from you terminal run

```
npm install -g sass
```

or download the package for your operating system from [GitHub](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases/tag/1.32.8) and [add it to your PATH](https://katiek2.github.io/path-doc/).

When SASS is installed, to compile your 'scss' file to 'css' run from your terminal

```
sass --watch scss/style.scss:css/style.css
```
