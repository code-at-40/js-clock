JavaScript 30 challenges | day #2 | JS clock

Logic done in JS, no CSS transitions and transformations.

See how it works [here](https://codepen.io/codeat40/pen/BapOyZb).

## Getting Started

If you want to edit this repo, you need to have installed SASS in your local machine to be able to compile the scss file in css.

If you don't need to use SASS, delete the 'scss' folder and edit the 'style.css' file directly.

### Prerequisites

To install SASS, from you terminal run

```
npm install -g sass
```

or download the package for your operating system from [GitHub](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases/tag/1.32.8) and [add it to your PATH](https://katiek2.github.io/path-doc/).

When SASS is installed, to compile your 'scss' file to 'css' run from your terminal

```
sass --watch scss/style.scss:css/style.css
```
